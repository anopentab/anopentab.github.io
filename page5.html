<body>


<p>One of the most popular ways to restrict access is by blocking website IP addresses.

    <br>
    <br>
    These IP addresses may be blocked by an internet service provider, a business, or a government entity.
    <br>
    <br>
    Another way to restrict access is based on keywords. This technique is often used in parental controls. Keyword restrictions look for specific words that may indicate something is inappropriate.

    <br>
    Some organizations use firewalls to filter and block content based on protocols, ports, network addresses, source IP addresses, or the destination IP address.
    <br>
