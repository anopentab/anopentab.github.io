<p>Net Neutrality:
    <br>
    <br>
    Net Neutrality policies are a national standard by which we ensure that broadband internet service is treated as an essential service. It prohibits internet service providers from blocking, throttling, or engaging in paid prioritization of lawful content.
<br>
    <br>
Just last month The Federal Communications Commission today voted to
    restore a national standard to ensure the internet is fast, open, and fair. The decision to
    reclassify broadband service as a Title II telecommunications service allows the FCC to protect
    consumers, defend national security, and advance public safety. Internet service providers controlling the content that is first displayed and readily accessed by users is just another subtle form of internet censorship.

<p>Foreign tourists in Europe
<br>
    <br>
    Traveling isn't just about discovering new cultures, food, and beautiful landscapes. It's also about going out of our everyday comfort zone. When traveling, people need to connect to unsafe public Wi-Fi networks to browse the web, for example.

    Even worse, some governments heavily control and restrict what users do on the internet. All this means that tourists may be risking their digital privacy or worse the use of their personal electronics, every time they go online overseas.
<br>
    When it comes to tourist cyber-traps, travel-related online scams might be the first thing that comes to mind. But tourists are subjected to the possibility of cyber attacks like phishing, DDoS attacks, and malware (viruses) being big issues.
