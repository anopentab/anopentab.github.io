<p>Internet censorship is very different around the world, ranging from little to no oversight to very pervasive control and surveillance.
<br>
<br>
Internet censorship in the US is among the least controlled in the world. This is mainly due to the fact that most online activity is protected by First Amendment rights.
<br>
    <br>
Internet control and surveillance in China is one of the strictest in the world. The Chinese government blocks a range of websites that contain content related to various historical independences, protests, freedom of speech, and pornography from its estimated 500 million Internet users.
